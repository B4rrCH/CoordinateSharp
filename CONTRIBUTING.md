### Pull Requests

It is asked that you are clear in specifying **WHAT** you changed and **WHY**. With that said there is no formal template for pull requests.
You may however be asked to adjust code if organization doesn't flow or code isn't clear. If you plan to make changes to celestial calculations,
an explanation of the changes will be sought.
